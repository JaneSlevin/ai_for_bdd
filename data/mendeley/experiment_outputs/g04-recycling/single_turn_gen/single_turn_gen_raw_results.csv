  Scenario: Verify environment-friendly indicator is present for compliant facilities
    Given I am on the facility listing page
    When I browse the list of facilities
    Then I should see a facility named ""EcoWaste Solutions""
    And I should see an ""Environment-Friendly"" indicator next to ""EcoWaste Solutions""

    When I browse the list of facilities
    Then I should see a facility named ""Standard Disposal Inc.""
    And I should not see an ""Environment-Friendly"" indicator next to ""Standard Disposal Inc.""

  Scenario: Verify filtering by environment-friendly facilities shows only compliant options
    Given I am on the facility listing page

    Then I should only see facilities with the ""Environment-Friendly"" indicator
    And I should not see any facilities without the ""Environment-Friendly"" indicator

  Scenario: Verify facility details page shows environment-friendly certification information
    Given I am on the facility listing page

    And I should see details about ""ISO 14001"" certification

    Then I should see a facility named ""Green Recycling Center""
    And I should see an ""Environment-Friendly"" indicator next to ""Green Recycling Center""
    And I should see ""Accepts: Plastic, Paper"" for ""Green Recycling Center""
